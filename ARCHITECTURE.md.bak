# Janito Architecture Overview

## High-Level Structure

Janito is a modular, extensible agent framework designed for interactive command-line and web-based chat environments. It emphasizes reliability, clear output, and easy extensibility through a tool/plugin system.

## Main Components

- **Agent Core**: Manages conversation state, message handling, and tool invocation.
- **Tools System**: Tools are registered via decorators and implement a standard interface for agent calls (see the [Tools Reference](../../janito/agent/tools/README.md)).
- **Message Handling**: All user and agent output is routed through a unified Rich-based message handler for consistent, styled output across CLI and web interfaces.
- **CLI Chat Shell**: Provides an interactive prompt using `prompt_toolkit`, with session management, command parsing, and real-time output.
- **Web App (optional)**: Shares the same agent and message handler logic for a consistent experience in browser-based chat.

## Message Flow

1. **User Input**: Captured via CLI or web UI.
2. **Agent Processing**: Agent receives input, updates conversation state, and determines if a tool should be invoked.
3. **Tool Invocation**: If needed, the agent calls a registered tool, passing arguments and receiving output.
4. **Output Routing**: All outputs (including tool results, errors, and info) are sent through the Rich message handler, which formats and displays them appropriately.
5. **History & State**: Conversation and input history are saved for session continuity.

## Extensibility

- **Adding Tools**: Implement a subclass of `ToolBase` and register it with `@register_tool`. Tools can report info, success, error, stdout, and stderr via the message handler. See the [Developer Guide](README_DEV.md) for details.
- **Output Customization**: The Rich message handler can be extended for new message types or output styles.

## Key Technologies

- **Python** (core language)
- **Rich** (for styled console output)
- **prompt_toolkit** (for advanced CLI interactivity)

---

## Notable Design Decisions

- Unified output handling with Rich for both CLI and web.
- Process tracking and robust error handling in tools (e.g., Bash tool).
- Simple, decorator-based tool registration for easy extensibility.
