# Tool: search_text

**Description:**
Search for a text pattern in all files within a directory and return matching lines. Respects .gitignore.

**Parameters:**
- `paths` (str): String of one or more paths (space-separated) to search in. Each path can be a directory or a filename.
- `pattern` (str): Regex pattern or plain text substring to search for in files. Tries regex first, falls back to substring if regex is invalid.
- `recursive` (bool): Whether to search recursively in subdirectories (directories only). Defaults to True.

**Returns:**
- Matching lines from files as a newline-separated string, each formatted as 'filepath:lineno: line'.
- If pattern is empty: "Warning: Empty search pattern provided. Operation skipped."

**Example usage:**
search_text(paths="src", pattern="def ", recursive=True)
