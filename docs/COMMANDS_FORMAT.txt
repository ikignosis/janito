# Command Format Specification

# 1. Basic Syntax Rules

# Line Types:
1. Comments: Lines starting with "#"
2. Commands: Lines without ":" or "." (using only alphanumeric chars)
3. Text blocks: Lines starting with "."
4. Key/Value pairs: Lines containing ": "
   - Direct value: Captured after ": " until line end
   - Multiline value: When value is empty, content is captured from lines below
     * Can contain: key/value pairs, text blocks, or nested commands
     * Cannot mix different types in same multiline value

# Value Formatting
Text blocks must provide each line between dots "."
Text blocks lines with leading dot but not trailing dot should be treated as an error

# NOTES
- Commands can be followed by parameters: text block or key/value pairs (not both)
- Both commands, key and values will be stripped of whitespaces
- Command parameters terminate when the next command at the same level is found
- Leading space must be ignored, the parser must rely on the order, not on the indentation of lines
- Inline comments are not supported (as it not meet line type 1)
- empty lines will be ignored

# Example:

Create File
    Path: file1.py
    Content: 
        .if true:.
        .    print("Hello World").

Modify File
    Path: file2.py
    Modifications:
        Search 
            .def old_function():.
            .    return 1.
        Replace
            .def new_function():.
            .    return 2.
