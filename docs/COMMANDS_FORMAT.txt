# Simple Text Commands Format

This format defines a structured way for an assistant to provide executable commands.

# Line Types
1. Comments: Lines starting with "#"
2. Commands: Simple lines without ":", "." or "#" (e.g., "Create File")
3. Text blocks: Lines starting with "."
4. Key/Value pairs: Lines containing ": "

# Structure Rules
- Commands can appear at root level or within multiline values
- Commands can have parameters as either:
  * Text blocks
  * Key/Value pairs
- Multiline values occur when a key's value is empty:
  * Must contain only one type: key/value pairs, text blocks, or commands
  * Commands form a sequence within the scope
  * Content is captured from indented lines below

# Formatting Rules
- Text blocks must prefix each line with "."
- Leading spaces are ignored
- Empty lines are ignored
- No inline comments allowed
- Both commands and key/values are whitespace-trimmed

# Example:

Create File
    Path: file1.py
    Content: 
        .if true:
        .    print("Hello World")

Modify File
    Path: file2.py
    Modifications:
        Search 
            .def old_function():
            .    return 1
        Replace
            .def new_function():
            .    return 2
