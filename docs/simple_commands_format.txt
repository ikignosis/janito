# Simple Commands Format
# Version: 1.0

# Overview
This format provides a structured way to define actionable commands for both LLMs and humans.

# Format Elements
1. Basic Line Types
   - Comments: Start with "#"
   - Commands: Simple lines (no ":", "." or "#")
   - Text blocks: Start with "."
   - Key/Value pairs: Contains ": "

# Command Structure
- Root level commands must:
  * Start with "Begin Simple Commands"
  * End with "End Simple Commands"
- Commands can have:
  * Text block parameters
  * Key/Value parameters
  * Nested command sequences

# Multiline Values
- Triggered by empty value after ":"
- Must contain one type only:
  * Key/value pairs
  * Text blocks
  * Command sequences
- Content should be indented below parent for easier human reading (not required per Syntax Rules 1)

# Syntax Rules
- Leading spaces and tabs: trimmed
- Empty lines: ignored
- key/values (both trimmed)
- text block lines, after the "." prefix, whitespaces must be preserved
- No inline comments

# Command execution order
- Execution of any command MUST only be performed after a syntax validation of the entire document
- Commands MUST be executed in the order they are presented in the sequence
- A command constaining nested comands is only considered completed when all the sub commands are completed
