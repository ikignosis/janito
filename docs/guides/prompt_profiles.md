# Janito System Prompt Profiles (Jinja2)

Janito now uses Jinja2 TXT files for all system prompt profiles and agent instructions. This replaces the previous Jinja2 template system.

## Format
- All prompt profiles are written in Jinja2 TXT (`.txt.j2`) files.
- Profiles are modular, supporting reusable fragments for operational and communication profiles.

## Structure
Profiles now support two main sections:
- **Operational Styles:** How the agent approaches tasks and operations.
- **Communication Styles:** How the agent interacts and communicates with users.

Fragments for these sections are defined in:
- `operational_profile_*.txt.j2`
- `communication_profile_*.txt.j2`

Profiles are composed dynamically: the profile manager selects the operational and communication profile fragments based on the profile name (e.g., `technical-concise`).

## Inheritance & Dynamic Composition
- Only one base template is needed: `system_prompt_template_base.txt.j2`.
- The base template includes profile fragments dynamically using variables:

```jinja2
{% block operational_profiles %}
    {% include operational_profile_fragment %}
{% endblock %}

{% block communication_profiles %}
    {% include communication_profile_fragment %}
{% endblock %}
```

- The profile manager sets `operational_profile_fragment` and `communication_profile_fragment` to the correct fragment filenames (e.g., `operational_profile_technical.txt.j2`, `communication_profile_concise.txt.j2`).

## Location
Prompt profiles and fragments are stored in `janito/agent/templates/profiles/`.

## Updating Profiles
- Update any custom prompt profiles to use the new dynamic fragment structure.
- See the profile fragments in `janito/agent/templates/profiles/` for reference.
