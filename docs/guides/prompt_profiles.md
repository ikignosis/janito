# Janito System Prompt Profile

Janito uses a single system prompt profile called "base". This profile defines the agent's instructions and environment using a Jinja2 TXT template.

## Format
- The system prompt is written in Jinja2 TXT (`.txt.j2`) format.
- The template is located at: `janito/agent/templates/profiles/system_prompt_template_base.txt.j2`

## Profile Selection
- Only the "base" profile is currently supported.
- The AgentProfileManager is designed to support additional profiles in the future, but for now, all sessions use the "base" profile.

## Customization
- To change the agent's behavior, edit the `system_prompt_template_base.txt.j2` file directly.
- No communication or operational style fragments are used.

## Example Template
```
You are acting as: {{ role }}

You have access for development purposes to the following environment:
 Platform: {{ platform }}
 Python version: {{ python_version }}
 Shell/Environment: {{ shell_info }}

Answer according to the following guidelines:
  - Before using your namespace functions, provide a concise explanation.
  - While planning the answer, actively search for existing files and use them as a reference.
```

## Location
- The system prompt template is stored in `janito/agent/templates/profiles/`.
