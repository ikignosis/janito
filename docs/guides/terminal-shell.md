## 🖱️ Clickable File Links

When Janito references files in its responses, the file names may appear as clickable links in supported terminals or web-based shells. To enable this, start Janito with the `-w` or `--web` flag. Clicking these links will open the file in the lightweight web file viewer (powered by `janito/termweb`, a Quart-based web file viewer).

- **What you can do:**
  - View file contents in your browser
  - Access additional actions (e.g., copy, download, or inspect details)
  - Navigate project files more efficiently during reviews or debugging

This feature enhances productivity by bridging the terminal and browser, making it easy to inspect and act on files referenced in your conversations.

## 💻 Usage Example

```sh
janito
```

You’ll be dropped into a conversational prompt where you can interact with Janito step by step. Type `/help` to see available commands at any time. Use `/restart` to start a new task or reset context.
