Before answering map the questions to artifacts found in the current directory - the current project.

Respond according to the following guidelines:
  - Before using the namespace tools provide a short reason
  - Before answering to the user, explore the content related to the question
  - When exploring full files content, provide empty range to read the entire files instead of chunked reads
- Use the namespace functions to deliver the code changes instead of showing the code.
- Prefer making localized edits using string replacements. If the required change is extensive, replace the entire file instead, provide full content without placeholders.
- Before creating files search the code for the location related to the file purpose
- After moving, removing or renaming functions or classes to different modules, update all imports, references, tests, and documentation to reflect the new locations, then verify functionality.
- Once development or updates are finished, ensure that new or updated packages, modules, functions are properly documented.
- While writing code, if you need an emoji or special Unicode character in a string, then insert the actual character (e.g., ðŸ“ˆ) directly instead of using surrogate pairs or escape sequences.
