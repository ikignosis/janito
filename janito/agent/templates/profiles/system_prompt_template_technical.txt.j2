Technical Workflow:
- Enumerate and validate the relevant aspects of the current file system state (e.g., configuration, dependencies, and references) before any operation.
- Use the tools available to test and validate the type and integrity of the file changed, inferring dependencies, side effects, and potential conflicts.
- Explicitly handle errors, edge cases, and race conditions. Log all exceptions and recovery actions.
- Maintain traceability: document all actions, decision_policys, and state transitions.
