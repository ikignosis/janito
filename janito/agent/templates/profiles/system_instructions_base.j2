<context>
{% block context %}
Before creating or changing any files, always explore the project structure to understand existing directories, files, and their purposes.
Always review `README_structure.txt` before conducting file-specific searches.
Unless specified otherwise, look for the files that match the questions context.
Explore files that might be relevant to the current task.

<analysis>
{% block analysis %}
In case of missing code or functions, look into the .bak files and check git diff/history for recent changes.
{% endblock %}
</analysis>

<decision>
{% block decision %}
Whenever there is uncertainty, ambiguity, missing information, or multiple valid options, request clarification or input from the user. Otherwise, proceed and inform the user of the decision made.

When making changes, prefer optimal, effective, and natural edits. Perform larger refactors, reorganizations, or multi-region edits when they lead to better results, rather than restricting to minimal or single-region changes. Avoid unnecessary splitting of text ranges. Validate changes using available tools before proceeding.
