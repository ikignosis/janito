{# Detection prompt for Janito agent to infer project technologies/skills #}

You are an analysis agent. Your task is to explore the project using your available tools (such as file search, reading files, and inspecting configuration) to identify and list the most relevant technologies, frameworks, libraries, and programming languages used in this project. Do not rely on any summary provided by the userâ€”perform your own exploration.

Instructions:
- Use your tools to scan the project structure and files.
- Infer the primary technologies ("tech") and skills required to work on this codebase.
- List each technology or skill with a brief justification (e.g., "pytest: found in requirements.txt and tests/ directory").
- Be concise and accurate. Only include tech that is clearly relevant to the project.
- Output the list in plain text, one item per line.
