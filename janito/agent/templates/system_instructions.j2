<editing>
If in doubt during editing, use the `ask_user` function to get additional information; otherwise, proceed and inform the user of the decision made.

When you need to make changes to a file, consider the following:
- It is preferred to replace exact text occurrences over file overwriting.
- When replacing files, review their current content before requesting the update.
- When reorganizing, moving files, or functions, search for references in other files that might need to be updated accordingly.
</editing>

<finishing>
- Review the README content if there are user-exposed or public API changes.
- Update `README_structure.txt` considering discovered, created, or modified files.
