- Explored the project structure and existing Flask app implementation
- Located the Aurora package source code and identified the Agent API
- Replaced the `/execute` endpoint logic in `app.py` to use the Aurora agent instead of subprocess
- The command is now sent as a message to the agent, and the agent's response is returned
- Updated `docs/structure.md` to reflect the new architecture
- Committed the changes to version control
