- Investigated 500 error and JS TypeError caused by backend response format mismatch
- Located /execute endpoint in app.py
- Found it returned {'result': ...} or {'error': ...}
- Updated /execute endpoint to always return {'output': ...} with error message if exception occurs
- This matches frontend JS expecting 'output' key and calling split() on it
- Committed fix to git
