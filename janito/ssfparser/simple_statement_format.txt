Version: 1.0

Overview

This document provides a format to provide actionable statements that should be easy to interpret by both humans and automation, include in various contexts, such as structured communication files or any scenario requiring standardized documentation.

Format Elements

A. Basic Line Types

The type of line is determined by these rules in order, based on the first character or pattern matched:
   1. Comment: Line starting with "#" are treated as comments and ignored during execution.
   2. Statement: Line that only contains alpha numeric chars
   3. Text blocks: Lines beginning with "." are treated as text blocks. The prefix "." must be followed by the desired text, preserving any whitespace after the prefix.  
   4. Key/Value pairs: Lines containing ":" are treated as key/value pairs, where keys are case sensitive.
   5. Section Start: Line start with / mark the start of a section e.g file/
   6. Section End: Lines ending with / mark the end of a section e.g. /file

B. Simple Statement Block Markers

A simple statement block must start with the line Begin Statements and finish End Statements, this are reserved statements for the unique purpose of location the inner statements (which provide the actual instructions)

C. Statements parameters 
    
All lines after a statements should be treated as statement parameters, finishing when a new statement line is found

D. Sections
    
Sections can be used to wrap text blocks or key/groups or sequences of commands.
Secions can provide metadata that might help the reader have a better  undertdating.
