## [Unreleased](https://github.com/ikignosis/janito/compare/v4.25.0...HEAD)

Changes since `v4.25.0` (2026-08-15).

### Changed

- `-S`/`--system-prompt` no longer disables tools; only `-Z`/`--no-system-prompt`
  suppresses them, so a custom system prompt can still use the built-in, Gmail,
  OneDrive and MCP tools. (`janito/cli/session_setup.py`,
  `janito/web/backend/config.py`)
