- The TermWeb file viewer/editor is now a dual-pane editor at the root route (/), using CodeMirror for editing and a togglable preview panel.
- All shell-generated file links should use /?path=... for view/edit capability.
- The /file endpoint is only for AJAX requests from the editor and is not for direct browser access.
- Direct raw file viewing is disabled for security and UX consistency.
- See janito/termweb/static/index.html for the main editor UI and integration logic.
